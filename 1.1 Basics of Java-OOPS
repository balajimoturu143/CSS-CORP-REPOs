Basics of Java and OOP in Java:

1) Java programming language was developed by James Gosling by sun Microsystems and released it in the year 1995 as a core component.
2) It was considered as core component of Sun Microsystems.
3) Java even supports multiple editions like - Java Platform Micro Edition(Java ME), Java Platform Standard Edition(Java SE), Java Platform Enterprise Edition(Java EE)
4) "Write once, Run anywhere" is one of the main reason why everyone love to learn and code in java.
5) Some of the important features of java are:
    - Platform Independent
    - Simple
    - Secure
    - Object Oriented
    - Portable
    - Multi threaded programs
    - Robust
    - Interpreted
    - High performance
6) Lifecycle of java program:
    - Edit
    - Compile
    - Load
    - Execute
7) Object Oriented Programming organizes a given program around objects and well-defined interfaces.
8) OOP Concepts in Java are:
    - Abstraction
        - Shows only necessary details of object to clients.
        - Public methods are the only methods which can be accesed by any client.
    - Encapsulation 
        - It hides the irrelavant information.
        - Most of the time, it hides the class implementations.
        - Helps in maintaining code.
    - Inheritance
        - It is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.
        - Used for Method Overriding, Code Reusability.
        - Mainly 3 types of inheritance:
            - Single inheritance
            - Multilevel inheritance
            - Hierarchical inheritance
    - Polymorphism
9) OOP tries to implement real world entities in programmatic manner.
